# Branca

This library is a spinoff from [folium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium),
that would host the non-map-specific features.

It may become a HTML+JS generation library in the future.

It is based on Jinja2 only.

There's no documentation,
but you can [browse the examples](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/python-visualization/branca/tree/master/examples) gallery.
